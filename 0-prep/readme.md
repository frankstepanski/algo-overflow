# Prep

## Pair Programming

- Asking clarifying questions: Talk through the problem and ask follow-up questions to make sure you understand the problem.

- Talk through the solution and talk about multiple solutions: Always code the quickest solution (usually brute force), but communicate to your interviewer there are others (assuming you know them) that could be more efficient (better time or space complexity).

- Talk as you code: There should be no more more than 1 minute of silence.

- If you get stuck, describe your best approach: Ask the interviewer if you should go with that approach. Your interviewer is there to help (should be) so make it as a "conversation" and as for guidance if needed. But don't just say "I’m stuck", talk through your approach and what you are unsure about.

- Try to pseudo-code before you code: If you have talked through your solution well enough, it can be acceptable to code without pseudo-coding, especially if you have limited time.

- Identify test-cases and edge-cases: If the problem only includes 1 test case, add more, and also mention input that could cause the code to break (e.g. empty, missing or incorrect inputs).

- Talk about trade-offs: As you talk about the time and space complexity, talk about the differences in approaches based upon Big O.

## Imposter Syndrome



## Why the Interview Sucks

You know what's worse than an interview that doesn’t actually test your ability as a software engineer? The fact that a good chunk of problems you will face in your interview have nothing to do with your ability to apply data structures/algorithms. Instead, it’s just testing your ability to come up with an algorithm and to parse the problem correctly. But that parsing can be a massive derailment.

It is one thing to say "x data structure can be used to optimize the solution". It’s another thing to say that because you can't figure out that you need to iterate in a particular way or you don't remember some weird mutation of 5th grade algebra that you don’t know your CS fundamentals. How stupid is it to say "You don’t remember your power rules therefore you don’t know what a stack is"?

The whole purpose of the interview should be to test how competent you are as an engineer. This means the interview should be an examination of your relevant skills to your profession and your abilities as an engineer. However, the less the interview tests this, the more it must be an examination of some other irrelevant skillset. Therefore, getting good at that irrelevant skill set will make the interview yield a false positive.

### What is the Interviewer NOT Looking for? aka Red Flags.

The biggest red flag when the candidate's code fails, is that they immediately reach for the debugger or logging statements. They don’t spend the time to really read and understand their own code and don't spend the time to figure out how to prevent writing these mistakes in the future.

It means they are not thinking about the structure of their code, much less how much impact that code has on the architecture or future development. After all, you cannot think of the bigger picture or how other code works with your code if you don't even know where your code is heading or what you’re doing. 

> Spend at least a few minutes reading over your own code and try to debug this without touching the keyboard.

Another red flag is the candidate ignores the help or fails to listen. If the interviewer gives you hints or help, really listen to what they are saying. Not being able to take feedback is an engineer that will not go far in their career.
 
The <strong>least important</strong> red flag is saying "I don’t know" or "I'm sorry maybe I don’t quite understand what you're asking". That's actually ok. 

Nobody knows everything. Sometimes things are confusing. Maybe you have indeed misunderstood what was being asked. 

What you should do is show you've made an effort and gone down every single rabbit hole you have found. Chances are there is something very simple you’ve overlooked. 

Coding is a collaborative craft and nobody has all the answers. But if you can go far with just a small hint, that's already a very good sign.

But saying "I don’t know" over and over again is a big fail though. In which case, study and practice more next time.

### What Should I Study?

20% of the material you study will be relevant to 80% of the interview questions and vice versa. That being said, there are a lot of small things you should know as well, not just how to manipulate data structures.

## The Secret to Solving Any Problem

- Understand the problem
- Make a plan
- Carry out the plan
- Look back and improve your solution

### Understand the problem

This is the most important and usually the most difficult step. If you understand the problem, the plan becomes obvious. If you have a solid plan, the code is easy to write. First, you must understand the problem.

Question to ask yourself to make sure you understand the problem:

- What is the problem asking you to do?
- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- Do you understand all of the words in the problem?
- Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
- Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider?

### Make a plan

- Break down the problem into smaller steps
- Draw out the problem
- Solve a simpler version of the problem
- Look for patterns
- Work backwards
- Guess and check

### Carry out the plan

This is the easiest of all the steps but it's also the one where most people get stuck. The reason for that is usually from coding without a plan, or executing a flawed plan because they don't quite understand the problem. If you've put time into steps 1 and 2, step 3 is mostly remembering syntax.

### Look back and improve your solution

Once you've come up with a solution, it's always good to revisit your code and make improvements. Sometimes that means fixing bugs or testing edge cases. Sometimes it means optimizing your code for readability or efficiency.
