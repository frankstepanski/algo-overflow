## The Secret to Solving Any Problem

- Understand the problem
- Make a plan
- Carry out the plan
- Look back and improve your solution

Credit to mathematician George Polya for coming up with these steps.

### Understand the problem

This is the most important and usually the most difficult step. If you understand the problem, the plan becomes obvious. If you have a solid plan, the code is easy to write. First, you must understand the problem.

Question to ask yourself to make sure you understand the problem:

- What is the problem asking you to do?
- Can you restate the problem in your own words?
- Do you understand all of the words in the problem?
- Do you have enough information to solve the problem?
- Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider?
